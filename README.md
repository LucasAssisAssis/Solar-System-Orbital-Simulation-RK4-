# Numerical Solar System Simulator (RK4)
This project aims to apply basic concepts regarding gravitational interactions on our Solar System by applying numerical methods such as Runge_Kutta4 and Verlet in order to compare their stability over time.

## Base Equation
- Gravitational force between two bodies:

$$\vec{F}_{21} = -G \frac{m_1 m_2}{|\vec{r}_{21}|^2} \hat{r}_{21}$$

### Libraries Used
- NumPy (Vector Calculus)
- Matplotlib (Vizualization)
